        <p>
          I am a Brooklyn-based developer formally trained in art. I have a
          background in public service, having worked as a consultant at a City
          of New York community board for seven years.
        </p>
        <p>
          From 2022 to 2023 I was a Software Engineer for ed-tech startup
          Newsela where I worked on two React.js internal content management
          systems for the content creation team. Prior to that, I worked as an
          Interaction Engineer at the ad tech startup TripleLift where I created
          bespoke, consumer-centric templates for programatic ads and developed
          the in-house React application our team used to create those
          templates.
        </p>
        <p>
          I strive to create visually interesting solutions that are broadly
          appealing. I believe tech should be intuitive, welcoming and
          delightful to interact with.
