#### Background

DSNY collects residential and public school refuse and recycling, empties street litter baskets, cleans up abandoned property such as cars, tires and bicycles and collects other types of refuse, such as the detritus left in public spaces after Superstorm Sandy. DSNY does not pick up commercial refuse from offices, shops, business, institutions or construction sites.

DSNY publishes monthly reports detailing how many tons of refuse, paper/cardboard and metal/glass/plastic/drink carton has been collected, categorized by borough and further categorized into Community District (CD). Currently the monthly report does not contain data on how much organic material is being collected.
